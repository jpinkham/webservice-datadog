# THIS IS NO LONGER MAINTAINED


WebService-DataDog
====================


DESCRIPTION
-----------
This module allows you to interact with DataDog (http://http://www.datadoghq.com/),
a service that will "Capture metrics and events, then graph, filter, and search
to see what's happening and how systems interact. Datadog is a service for IT,
Operations and Development teams who write and run applications at scale, and
want to turn the massive amounts of data produced by their apps, tools and
services into actionable insight."

This module encapsulates all the communications with the REST API provided by
DataDog to offer a Perl interface to metrics, dashboards, events, alerts, host
tags, etc.

You can find your API key, and generate application keys at
https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings

For help with graph definitions (when creating/updating dashboards), please visit

INSTALLATION
-------------

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install


NOTES
------

 * WebService::DataDog::Alert is deprecated and is no longer supported by DataDog.
This Perl wrapper will soon have a replacement Monitor module that utilizes the
replacement "monitor" endpoint in the DataDog API.

 * WebService::DataDog::Alert, in retrieve() and update():
A 404 response typically indicates an incorrect alert id was specified

 * WebService::DataDog::Comment, in create():
There may be a race condition that exists between comment creation and comment
creation that is tied to the aformentioned comment.  Tests run successfully
in a consistent manner only when a short "sleep" is added between parent comment
creation and child comment creation.

 * WebService::DataDog::Comment, in create() and update():
The 'handle' parameter must specify a username on the "team" (https://app.datadoghq.com/account/team)
associated with your account, otherwise your update will fail with a 400 or 404
error.
	
 * WebService::DataDog::Dashboard, in delete():
You cannot remove system-generated or integration dashboards.

 * WebService::DataDog::Event, in retrieve():
Receiving a 404 response likely means the requested event id does not exist

 * WebService::DataDog::Metric, in emit():
Only metrics of type 'gauge' and type 'counter' are supported. You must use a
dogstatsd client such as Net::Dogstatsd to post metrics of other types
(ex: 'timer', 'histogram', 'sets' or use  increment() or decrement() on a counter).
The primary advantage of the API vs dogstatsd for posting metrics: API supports
specifying a timestamp, thereby allowing posting metrics from the past.

 * WebService::DataDog::Tag, in add(), retrieve(), update():
A 404 response typically indicates you specified an incorrect/unknown host name/id.
Also, all methods, except retrieve_all(), operate on a per-host basis rather than
on a per-tag basis. You cannot rename a tag or delete a tag from all hosts,
through the DataDog API. *Tags containing two colons will not be allowed because
it causes confusion in the graphing interface, which "drills down" based on
key:value pairs (using a single colon).
